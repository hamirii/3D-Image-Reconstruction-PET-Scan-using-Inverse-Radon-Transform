# 3D-Image-Reconstruction-PET-Scan-using-Inverse-Radon-Transform
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a technique used in a variety of applications within medicine and research, primarily in imaging tumors. Two Sodium-22 (Na-22) sources were placed side by side and imaged through this PET technique, where only the photons emitted in coincidence by the samples were counted. An image was reconstructed through an inverse radon transform to investigate the relative location and shape of each source with respect to the other, and a resolution of approximately 1mm ±0.5mm by 1mm ±0.5mm was determined to be the resolution of the apparatus.

This project was completed as part of a 4th year Physics Course (PHYS409 - Experimental Physics)
